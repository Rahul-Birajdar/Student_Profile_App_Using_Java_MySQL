# Task 1 - Student Profile App

🔍 Project Overview: The Feedback Application allows users to submit their feedback, along with a rating, which is then stored in a database for future reference. The application ensures data integrity and user input validation for a smooth and efficient feedback collection process.

💻 Key Features :
✅ User-friendly interface to enter feedback and rate services.
✅ Form validation to ensure data integrity.
✅ Dynamic star rating system for easy rating selection.
✅ Stores feedback securely in a MySQL database.
✅ Packaged with JSP for easy web deployment.

💡 Data Validations : 
✅ Name: Ensures the name field is not empty, contains only alphabetic characters, and is not blank.
✅ Feedback: Ensures the feedback field is at least 10 characters long.
✅ Rating: Captured through an interactive star rating system.

🛠️ Technologies Used :
🔹Frontend : JSP (JavaServer Pages), HTML, CSS (for styling)
🔹Backend : Java, MySQL
🔹Database Connectivity : JDBC
🔹Validation and Interactivity : JavaScript

📜 How It Works:
The application allows users to enter their name, rate the service using a star rating system, and provide detailed feedback. JavaScript ensures the inputs are valid before submission. Upon submission, the data is stored securely in a MySQL database using JDBC, and a thank you message is displayed to the user.
