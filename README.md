Designed and developed a Java-based GUI application that captures and stores student profile information using the following technologies :

âœ… Java : Core programming language\n
âœ… Swing : For creating a user-friendly GUI
âœ… JDBC : For database connectivity
âœ… MySQL : To store student profiles

ðŸ’¡Key Features :
âœ… User-friendly interface to enter student details.
âœ… Form validation to ensure data integrity.
âœ… Stores data securely in a MySQL database.
âœ… Packaged as a JAR File for easy execution by just clicking the file.

ðŸ’¡Data Validations :
âœ…Name : Ensures the name field is not empty and contains only alphabetic characters.
âœ…Phone Number : Ensures the phone number is field is not empty and contains exactly 10 digits long and numeric.
âœ…Email : Ensures the email field is not empty and follows a valid email format.
âœ…Gender : Ensures that either "Male" or "Female" is selected.
âœ…Programming Languages : Ensures at least one programming language is selected.

ðŸ’¡How it Works:
The application collects details such as the student's name, phone number, email, gender, and programming languages. It validates the input and then saves it to the database, ensuring a seamless and secure data entry process.
